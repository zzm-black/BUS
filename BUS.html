	CASE: Li-Ning Sportswear
	Will Chinese sportswear company Li-Ning continue to maintain its momentum in 2022?
	On 11 April 2022, Chinese sportswear company Li-Ning released its annual financial report.
	In 2021, Li-Ning achieved revenue of 22.5 billion RMB ($3.54 billion), an increase of 56%
	compared with the previous year. In terms of net profit, the figure reached 4 billion RMB
	($630 million), an increase of 136% compared with 2020. 2021 has so far been their topperforming year since being listed on the Hong Kong Stock Market back in June 2004.
	One of the most important reasons behind the huge increase in revenue, is the rise of Guochao
	in China, with Li-Ning becoming one of few brands leading the trend. As a result, the company
	has enjoyed a lot of public attention due to its rising popularity.
	Li-Ning first came up with the idea of Guochao in 2018, and it was also the first Chinese
	sportswear brand to participate in “Tmall China Day” that same year during New York
	Fashion Week. After fashion week, they launched a sub-brand that positions itself as a sports
	fashion brand of Li-Ning. With the help of the sub-brand, Li-Ning has expanded its business
	in the Chinese sports fashion market and started attracting a much younger Gen-Z audience.
	In the past 4 years, with the help of two major trends (sports fashion and Guochao), Li-Ning
	finally made its brand upgrade after an inventory crisis and achieved great success with the
	younger generation.
	However, Li-Ning still has a long way to go compared to international sportswear giants such
	as Nike and Adidas, not to mention its biggest Chinese rival – Anta. Also, as Chinese
	sportswear companies of all sizes are now following the trend of Guochao, it remains a huge
	challenge for Li-Ning to maintain this competitive edge in the long run.
	If we look at Nike’s development throughout the years, we see that choosing the right
	marketing strategies and platforms is crucial for a sportswear brand, which is what Li-Ning
	2
	BUS4301 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
	needs to prioritize at the current stage of their business if they are to take on these big global
	players.
	Chinese elements appeal to young fitness enthusiasts
	Consumers' increasing attachment to products or designs with distinctive Chinese features - a
	trend more extensively found among the younger generation -has facilitated the rise of
	Chinese brands despite global uncertainties and economic headwinds, said industry experts.
	A report jointly released by news portal Xinhuanet and fashion brand exchange and trading
	platform Dewu in late June said Chinese consumers' interest in products and brands with
	distinctive Chinese cultural features surged five-fold during the 10 years between 2011 and
	2021.
	The trend has been especially noticeable among younger consumers. Dewu, which had 81
	million monthly active users in May, said up to 87 percent of consumers buying products with
	strong Chinese features on their platform are those born in the 1990s or 2000s.
	These younger consumers have shown special preferences for Chinese features like color
	palettes widely found in Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, Gansu province; brands associated
	with the Sanxingdui Ruins in Guanghan, Sichuan province; or batik produced by the Miao
	ethnic group, Dewu said. Fiscal results reported by domestic sportswear brands Anta and LiNing during the first half may also provide a glimpse into rising Chinese brands.
	Anta overtook international giants like Nike and Adidas for the first time to become the topselling sports company in the Chinese mainland market in the first six months, with its halfyear sales revenue approaching 26 billion yuan ($3.8 billion). Anta's eye-catching sales
	revenue can be partly attributed to international brands such as Descente and Fila that Anta
	has acquired over the past few years. The 12.4 billion yuan turnover that Li-Ning made in the
	3
	BUS4301 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
	first six months is worth a closer look, according to industry experts.
	On one hand, Li-Ning overtook Anta by recording a 17.6 percent net profit margin in the first
	half, while that of Anta came in at 13.8 percent. On the other hand, Li-Ning's strategy of
	playing up Chinese characteristics in its products and designs and its ambition to break the
	monopoly of Western brands in terms of fashion design seems to have begun to make a
	difference, as younger Chinese consumers are more inclined to products with strong Chinese
	cultural element, said Yi Fan, a senior analyst from market research firm MKT Index.
	Di Junpeng, an analyst from Institute of Economics at Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences,
	said Chinese brands and products are carriers of Chinese values. As younger Chinese
	consumers show more recognition and confidence in traditional Chines culture, it is
	understandable to see the rise of Chinese brands, whose quality has also significantly
	improved over time, Di said.
	The increasing inclination for products with distinctive Chinese cultural elements or colors
	has helped elevate overall recognition of Chinese brands, said Dewu experts.
	A similar finding was reached by market consultancy Kantar Worldpanel. In the Chinese
	global brand builders 2022 list jointly released by Google in late July, the London-based
	market research firm said that the top Chinese 50 brands making the list this year have seen
	their overall brand influence up an average 6 percent year-on-year despite all the global
	uncertainties.
	The function, design and profitability of these Chinese brands have taken the lead worldwide,
	helping them further increase global market share and promote brand value, said Kantar
	experts.
	According to Jay Fang, senior partner at the Chengdu, Sichuan province, and Chongqing
	offices of KMPG in China, the booming digital economy in China and the new consumption
	4
	BUS4301 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
	models have nurtured a large number of domestic brands, which have won the hearts of
	younger consumers with quality, innovation and corporate social responsibilities fulfilled.
	"Despite intense competition in the consumer sector, domestic brands with distinctive Chinese
	characteristics have leapfrogged. This is not only attributable to reasonable prices but also the
	personalized management especially catering to the tastes and preferences of the younger
	generation," Fang said.
	As the KPMG analyst explained, technological innovation will be key to the upgrading of
	these domestic brands. Personalized and rapid delivery, as well as experience found nowhere
	else, are increasingly emphasized by younger consumers. Domestic brands are recommended
	to invest more in technology and supply chains to secure the upper hand in the fiercely
	competitive Chinese consumer market.
	China’s Up-and-Coming Sports Gear Makers: When Politics Meets Business
	When Xi Jinping took center stage in early 2022 for the Beijing Winter Olympics’ opening
	ceremony, he was sporting a marine blue parka – specifically, one made by Canadian outfitter
	Arc’teryx. While the brand may be a foreign one at first glance, it was actually acquired by
	Chinese sporting goods manufacturer ANTA Sports in 2019. The jacket sold out in China
	immediately. ANTA, official sportswear partner of the Olympic games, went on to reap the
	benefits of that status throughout the 17-day event: Chinese athletes including star skier Eileen
	Gu were all outfitted in ANTA gear, making the brand omnipresent and rocketing sales to
	previously unseen levels, an increase of up to 15-fold. But the very reasons that business at
	home has boomed for China’s sports gear makers is complicating their international
	endeavors.
	How ANTA and Li-Ning Gained a Foothold at Home: Before this spotlight, ANTA was
	5
	BUS4301 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
	relatively unknown internationally, and that was doubly so for its Chinese rival, Li-Ning. For
	decades, American company Nike and Germany’s Adidas dominated international markets
	for sporting goods and apparel. With their global market presence, world-leading athletes
	under sponsorship, and products that transcend the lines between sports and urban fashion,
	both have built well-known, global brands over the last 50 years.
	Until recently these two foreign brands held a duopoly in the Chinese market as well, but now
	the tides are turning. After the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) revoked their certification of
	cotton from China’s autonomous region Xinjiang over allegations of forced labor, a cascade
	of events followed. Western companies that renewed their support to the BCI and suspended
	the use of cotton sourced from the region, including Adidas and Nike, felt the fury of Chinese
	consumers. ANTA, on the other hand, originally the first Chinese company to join the BCI,
	stated that it “will keep buying and using China cotton” and subsequently quit the
	organization, while Li-Ning made public statements saying it wasn’t even part of the initiative.
	In the Chinese market, the results of this embrace of the party line on Xinjiang were soon
	obvious. As the two Western brands’ sales slumped by between 15 percent and 20 percent
	year-on-year in the last quarter of 2021, ANTA and Li-Ning capitalized on this nationalist
	shift, dethroning Adidas and Nike from the top spots in e-commerce sales.
	A Politicized Business Environment Complicates International Expansion: Contrary to the
	favorable developments in their domestic market, the international repercussions for ANTA
	and Li-Ning are far from rosy. Both have already made efforts to expand overseas, albeit with
	mixed results.
	ANTA has been acquiring foreign, longstanding brands, including Japanese ski gear maker
	DESCENTE, the China business of Italian FILA, and Finnish sports company Amer, which
	in turn owns the aforementioned Arc’teryx of Canada favored by Xi Jinping. Contrary to the
	rapid departure from the BCI by its parent, ANTA, Finnish Amer has remained in the BCI.
	6
	BUS4301 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
	This zigzag of ethical alignment has so far paid off – not only because a popular boycott
	against Amer and its sub-brands has yet to happen, but also because Amer increased its
	revenues in the last fiscal year to a record high, exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Nevertheless,
	revenue for parent company ANTA is still almost exclusively generated in China.
	Chinese rival Li-Ning has so far been focusing on exports, especially to the United States. As
	late as October 2021, the company was seeking funding for its newest attempt to venture
	overseas. But these plans hit a wall within months. First, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund
	excluded Li-Ning from its portfolio over “serious human rights violations.” A mere week
	later, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced an all-out import ban on Li-Ning
	products after an investigation identified North Korean forced labor in its supply chain. LiNing responded by discounting these allegations as “overseas speculations.”
	As Western Liberal Values Clash with Authoritarianism, Businesses Will Need to Adapt: The
	combination of these headwinds has made it impossible for both Chinese contenders to gain
	a significant foothold in most liberal market economies – less because of mistaken business
	decisions and more due to an increasingly politicized business environment. As such, ANTA
	and Li-Ning are case studies of a new paradigm: While in the past, clashes over values
	between liberal market economies and authoritarian regimes were confined mostly to culture
	and ideology, in today’s increasingly polarized world the array of affected products is ever
	expanding. Now, even something as mundane as sporting goods and apparel is drawn into the
	vortex of politicization.
	For Western companies, this development is nothing new, especially for consumer-facing
	brands that have had to cautiously navigate the China market and steer away from the many
	red lines of Chinese politics: Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Tibet, to name just a few. For the
	involved companies, mistakes were costly, as party-state media often responds by fueling
	popular boycotts. For China’s ruling party, however, the applied pressure has been a useful
	7
	BUS4301 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
	tool of economic coercion.
	As Chinese firms venture abroad into an increasingly politicized global business landscape,
	they themselves must now maneuver carefully to avoid rubbing either side the wrong way.
	ANTA and its Finnish subsidiary Amer demonstrate that a one-size-fits-all approach to ethical
	governance is impossible when the East-West rift is ever deepening. But other attempts to
	localize political alignment have backfired in the past. German retailer Hugo Boss, for
	example, publicly proclaimed to the United States’ NBC News that it does not source from
	Xinjiang, only to slyly tell Chinese customers the exact opposite shortly later. Once such a
	flip-flop is noticed by observers, the fallout will be even worse. And even if localizing the
	political alignment on a subsidiary basis may work for a brief period, Li-Ning’s import ban
	has shown that issues can transcend final products and run back up the supply chain.
	Xi Jinping’s display of ANTA-owned fashion at the Olympics may have been unsurprising –
	after all, the company was a main sponsor. But it symbolizes a growing trend: As long as
	Chinese firms match the interpretation of values, including human and labor rights, prescribed
	by the party, they can enjoy state support. As inherently Chinese companies, both ANTA and
	Li-Ning will thus likely remain loyal to the CCP’s understanding of human rights, especially
	as their domestic revenues dwarf anything they earn abroad. Furthermore, they are in ideal
	positions to leverage Beijing’s push to boost China’s sports sector to 5 trillion RMB by 2025.
	In contrast to the favorable circumstances at home, however, international business expansion
	into liberal market economies will only become more challenging and require painful
	decisions. The European Parliament recently passed a resolution that seeks to clamp down on
	the import of Chinese products exploiting forced labor and particularly targeted the Xinjiang
	region. Furthermore, this issue has already attracted the attention of policymakers in the
	United Kingdom. Such regulatory moves are likely to create severe challenges for both
	Chinese sports gear makers.

	BUS4301 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
	Other emerging economies may offer an alternative route to grow business, but only time will
	tell whether or not ANTA and Li-Ning can reproduce their success to challenge the dominance
	of Nike and Adidas in other countries.
	Nike Feels the Burn as Anta and Li-Ning Continue Their Winning Streak
	As Greater China headwinds continue to buffet Nike, domestic brands are thriving: Hong
	Kong-listed sportswear group Anta celebrated its 30th anniversary last year with solid sales
	growth and a pledge to expand its market share, while Chinese sportswear label Li-Ning
	outshone larger rivals with a rocketing sales growth of 56 percent — which saw all segments
	perform well.
	Hong Kong-listed sportswear label Anta celebrated its 30th anniversary last year with solid
	sales growth and a pledge to expand its market share in China over the next five years. The
	“Lead to Win” acceleration plan falls within a wider 10-year strategy “to become a globalised
	multi brand sportswear group.”
	In 2021, revenue rose by 39 percent to $7.75 billion (49.3 billion RMB), with roughly half of
	this coming from Anta itself (which grew by 53 percent). Fila used to be the largest in the
	group but it grew only half as fast in 2021 and was overtaken. The two outfits together account
	for 93 percent of the company’s total revenue, with others such as Descente and Kolon Sport
	making up the rest.
	Now that Anta has taken the lead, it is likely to keep it. The label has just over 9,400 stores
	(mostly in the mainland), far outstripping Fila which owns a little more than 2,000. As the
	official partner of the Beijing Winter Olympics, Anta provided Chinese athletes like Eileen
	Gu, and Wu Dajing with equipment and apparel — enjoying huge exposure as a result. The
	sales impact will be seen in the coming quarters.

	August saw China’s State Council push forward with a mass fitness program, which is
	projected to generate billions in income for the sportswear industry. In addition, the highly
	fragmented kids wear market is still under-exploited (the top 10 sports brands combined have
	only a 20 percent market share), making it a target for Anta.
	Despite the strong performance and prospects, the group’s stock tumbled after its results were
	released on March 22, continuing a steady decline. During the past month, the shares slipped
	by 8.7 percent and they are down 32 percent over the past 12 months.
	Chinese sportswear label Li-Ning, currently ranked 18th in the Jing Daily Krane Shares China
	Global Luxury Index, outshone larger rivals during 2021 with a rocketing sales growth of 56
	percent which saw all segments — apparel, footwear, and equipment/accessories — perform
	well.
	Annual sales reached $3.55 billion (22.6 billion RMB) while operating profit more than
	doubled to $807 million (135 million RMB). E-commerce has now reached 30 percent of sales
	— up from 19 percent in 2017.
	The group stayed focused on five core areas: basketball, running, fitness, badminton, and
	sports casual and put R&D investment into professional products. By presenting an original
	interpretation of Chinese culture and fashion in new lines, it has expanded its consumer base.
	Li-Ning also further diversified its entertainment marketing model for the sports casual
	category: with emphasis on sports fashion segments favored by young consumers.
	At the end of 2021, Li-Ning points of sale in the mainland (excluding Li-Ning Young kids
	wear stores) rose marginally to 5,935. Last year, Li Ning Young positioned itself as the
	“fashionable professional sports kids wear brand originating in China” to capitalize on rising
	Chinese patriotism.
	Referencing the Covid pandemic, Li-Ning (the eponymous joint CEO of the group) stated that
	10
	BUS4301 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
	“health consciousness has been rising and demand for sporting goods has remained robust.
	Against this backdrop, we continued to focus on the value of the Li-Ning experience and have
	demonstrated stronger brand resilience. We strongly believe the sports industry has a
	promising outlook.”
	Hong Kong-listed Li Ning stock bounced upwards after it announced its annual numbers on
	March 18. Over the past month it is up almost 3 percent, and over 12 months it has risen by
	12 percent. Greater China headwinds continued to buffet global sportswear giant Nike in the
	three months up to February as revenue in the region contracted yet again, though this time
	by 8 percent instead of double digits.
	Nike may have been helped in the quarter by the “Never Done” campaign during the Beijing
	Winter Olympics, which featured snowboarder Cai Xuetong and picked up 6.1 billion
	impressions.
	But as the only region to be negative, Greater China dented Nike’s global growth. Total
	revenue rose 8 percent to $10.9 billion on a currency-neutral basis in the company’s fiscal
	third quarter, led by Asia Pacific/Latin America with a 19 percent hike. Greater China
	contributed $2.16 billion.
	CFO Matt Friend said in an investor call that he was upbeat when it came to China, noting
	that results there “were in line with expectations, with sequential improvement versus the prior
	quarter.” He added: “As we continued rebuilding local brand activities in this quarter, Nike
	was rated the #1 cool and #1 favorite brand in China. We are also observing improvements in
	full-price realization.”
	Nike is now stepping up its marketplace strategy to drive more personalized shopping across
	e-commerce and physical platforms. Last quarter, the business announced a new partnership
	model. “It gives shoppers the benefits of Nike membership to unlock exclusive offers,
	11
	BUS4301 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
	products, and experiences in partner stores,” Friend explained.
	Part of the process is to onboard members in stores, which tends to accelerate in-store
	conversion. “This quarter, we extended this model globally, including two new connected
	partners in Greater China: Topsports and Pou Sheng,” Friend added. Nike’s results (released
	March 21) did not have a major impact on the stock. Over the past month, the shares are up 5
	percent but so far this year (to April 8), they are down 23 percent.
	Li-Ning could contrast Nike in China?
	Shares in Chinese brand Li-Ning rose 10.74% on the Beijing stock exchange in the past week.
	The growth in the brand's prices follows the 4.2% increase in turnover in 2020 (the only
	fashion company to record revenue growth in 2020 together with Hermes) and, as the Jing
	Daily reports, both would be the result of the current 'cotton crisis' taking place in China -
	explained here.
	Against this background, it is thought that Li-Ning could exploit Nike's market problems in
	China to gain further popularity and take over, in terms of sales, precisely the place of the
	American brand. Shares in sports brands such as adidas and Nike fell after China blocked
	imports of their products, while Chinese brands raised their prices. Among other things, the
	Chinese football and basketball sports federations, both sponsored by Nike, which according
	to Footy Headlines, in private discussed potential legal actions against the American brand,
	also entered the discussion.
	Considering Nike's fall in China and Li-Ning's economic rise, is it possible that the Chinese
	brand could overcome the American brand in the Chinese market?
	Li-Ning (like Anta) is a brand that despite having worked a lot on its image (also in the
	Western world: both with the opening in 2010 of a store in the United States and with the
	sponsorship of two basketball stars such as Wade and Jimmy Butler) failed in China to surpass
	12
	BUS4301 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
	a giant like Nike. The Chinese brand proposes models at cheap prices and exploits, as far as
	possible, China's restrictions on Western brands - remember, for example, the controversy
	between the Brooklyn Nets and China after the New York team had publicly supported Hong
	Kong: the consequence was the cancellation of a franchise event in China. Given the current
	situation where Western players are momentarily out of the game, Li-Ning is trying again
	with new strategies.
	For example, the Beijing-based brand has signed a contract with Xao Zhan, frontman of
	Chinese pop group X NINE, a boy band very famous in China. The brand immediately
	presented a collection with shooting of Zhan and merch promptly put up for sale: the result
	was the sold out of the garments after 25 minutes that the collection had been put online.
